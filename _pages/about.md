Hi!, I'm Wei Jie Yeo, currently a PhD student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, supervised by Prof. Erik Cambria. My main research interests lies between the intersection of NLP and Interpretability, with a focus on improving the current lack of understanding in how AI systems model various complex behaviors. Lately, I have been deeply interested in finding ways to utilize interpretability to improve problems in AI safety, such as jailbreak or prompt injection attacks.

## Employment
My expected graduation is somewhere towards the end of this year and will be actively seeking a full-time position in the industrial sector. Feel free to connect if you think I am a suitable candidate! [CV](/files/Resume.pdf)
